Make sure you have Mini conda pre-installed and Python.

for that use:

and

download mini conda through this link : https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/

Open the files in VS code and the terminal within VS code, in there make sure to create a virtual environment using mini-conda. After that, copy the activation key and add it to the "Activation key" file, after removing the content the file already contains.
